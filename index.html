    <h2>About the SALMA Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        The first workshop on Speech and Audio Language Models (SALMA) aims to unite researchers specializing in various aspects of speech and audio understanding and language models. This workshop facilitates in-depth discussions and identifies synergies to develop effective methodologies aimed at leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance performance across tasks in speech, audio, and music domains, such as classification, generation, and retrieval. Some of the fundamental questions that this workshop aims to address are:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>How can we effectively integrate LLMs into existing speech and audio processing pipelines to improve task performance?</li>
        <li>What are the innovative applications of LLMs in the realm of audio processing, such as text-guided audio generation and segmentation, and how can these be further developed?</li>
        <li>What advancements in neural network architectures can facilitate better performance of multimodal and cross-modal LLMs in speech and audio processing tasks?</li>
        <li>What novel training algorithms and data sources (real and synthetic) can be leveraged to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in speech and audio processing?</li>
        <li>How can we refine evaluation methods to more accurately measure the effectiveness of LLMs in enhancing speech and audio technologies, and what metrics should be considered?</li>
        <li>What synergies can be identified through collaboration among researchers in the fields of speech, audio, and LLMs to drive innovation and address the current challenges in the domain?</li>
    </ol>
